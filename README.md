# Widget App
We used Spring and Angular to build a web application that can display data from several sources in widget form.

## Features:
- widgets can be weather, calendar, stock or comic type
- backend can manage how often widgets are refreshed to prevent excess api calls

## To run:
- install spring boot
- install mysql
- create database with name and account 
- install angular
- run backend and frontend projects simultaneously
- api keys with environment variables matching the code are required

## API's we used:
- [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/)
- [Yahoo Finance](https://www.yahoofinanceapi.com/)
