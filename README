MUST HAVES:

Originate from a Secure Origin. 
    Served over TLS and green padlock displays (no active mixed content).

Load while offline (even if only a custom offline page).
    By implication, this requires use of Service Workers and Fetch Handlers.

Reference a Web App Manifest with at least the following properties:
    name
    short_name
    start_url
    display (with a value of standalone or fullscreen)
    an icon at least 144x144 large in png format

NICE TO HAVE:
	
Message boards.
    Users can make posts and comments.
