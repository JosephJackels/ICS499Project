We are looking to build a progressive web application with widgets displaying several data sources and features.

MUST HAVES:

Originate from a Secure Origin. 
    Served over TLS and green padlock displays (no active mixed content).

Load while offline (even if only a custom offline page).
    By implication, this requires use of Service Workers and Fetch Handlers.

Reference a Web App Manifest with at least the following properties:
    name
    short_name
    start_url
    display (with a value of stand-alone or full-screen)
    an icon at least 144x144 large in png format

NICE TO HAVE:

Other uses:
    Base functionality for our project will revolve around weather data. 
    However, if possible we would like to expand this functionality to incorporate other data sources as well.
    This could include sports data, stock data or anything else we can think of. 

Message boards.
    Users can make posts and comments.

Chat rooms. 
    Users can utilize text based chat rooms.

Possible API's to use:

    Weather: OpenWeatherMap - https://openweathermap.org/
